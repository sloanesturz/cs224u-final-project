- "first and third" -- super complex coreference
If the first and third of three consecutive even integers are added, the result is 12 less than three times the second integer. find the integers.

- "have a sum of"
what three consecutive odd integers have a sum of -75?

- sentence formation of "If <something> the result is <something>" (should be achievable)
The sum of two numbers is 64. If twice the smaller number is subtracted from the larger number, the result is 16. Find the two numbers.
One number is 16 more than another. If the smaller number is subtracted from 2/3 of the larger, the result is 1/4 of the sum of the two numbers. Find the numbers.

- gives us the eqn x, x+1, etc.
Three times the sum of three consecutive integers x, x + 1, and x + 2, is 72. What are the integers?

- Right now we just parse 2y = 17 + z .. miss the constraint of x = y - 1 = z - 2
Find 3 consecutive numbers such that twice the second is 17 more than the third.

- digit manipulation
a no. has two digits whose sum is 14. if 36 is added to the no., its digits are interchanged. find the no.
